## Book store

Practice the use of dynamically reserved and resizable tables of data structure elements. In this program, I create a simple database for storing books. Each record in the database follows the ```struct book``` structure, and the database consists of a dynamically allocated table, which has several ```struct book``` instances in a row. Whenever a new item is added to a table, it must be ensured that the table has enough memory to store the new item.
