<!-- C-programming -->
## C-programming
C is an all-time programming language, which still keeps relevant even nowadays. For this reason, 
in this repository I built small C programs to explore various topics around this language, like:
pointers, memory management, strings, bit-wise operations and multi-dimensional arrays.

### Code
Following the codes I wrote for this repository and a brief description about them:

* [**Data structures**](src/data-structures): Practice use of data structures, as a member of dynamically allocated (and re-sized) array by creating a simple [book store database](src/data-structures/book-store). In addition I am including a simple [queue](src/data-structures/queue) implemented using linked lists.

* [**Game of life**](src/gameoflife): Implementation of the [*Game of Life*](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) by Conway, using dynamically allocated arrays to create the game area with randomly distributed organisms.

* [**TCP header**](src/tcpheader): Practice bit-wise binary operations by implementing the TCP header structure according to this [*definition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure).

* [**Olympics**](src/olympics): This program implements a simple database which contains the registry of medals from countries which can be loaded from a file, writen to a file or entered manually and updated accordingly.

### Built with
* C 
* Compiler version: ``gcc (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0``
